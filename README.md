# About

This simple bank app in C++ was created for personal learning purposes. It's an extremely basic project meant for getting started with C++ programming. If you'd like to clone or use this code, feel free to do so. Keep in mind that this project is intentionally primitive and lacks comprehensive banking functionalities.
